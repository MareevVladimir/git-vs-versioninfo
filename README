Git - Visual Studio VERSIONINFO Generator
=========================================

Overview
--------
This project uses an MS-DOS batch file to parse the output of git-describe and
generate a header to be included in a project's file version resource.  So that
it can be used by people who are building from source without having git the
script uses development stage build version numbering based on a git tag when
git is available and a version file or default value for when git is not.

Usage
-----
This can be run from the command line.  It uses the following arguments:

  [--force] [CACHE_PATH] OUT_FILE

  --force - ignore the cached output of a previous run even if the git-describe
            version hasn't changed.
  CACHE_PATH  - Path for non-tracked file to store git-describe version.
  OUT_FILE - Path to writable file that is included in the project's rc file.

  Example pre-build event:
  CALL $(SolutionDir)..\scripts\GIT-VS-VERSION-GEN.bat $(IntDir) $(SolutionDir)..\src\fileversioninfo.h
