Git - Visual Studio VERSIONINFO Generator
=========================================

Overview
--------
This project uses an MS-DOS batch file to parse the output of git-describe and
generate a header to be included in a project's file version resource.  For
building from source without having git the script can use a version file or
embedded default value.

Usage
-----
This can be run from the command line.  It uses the following arguments:

	usage: [--help] ^| [--force] [CACHE PATH] [OUT FILE]

	When called without arguments version information writes to console.

	--help      - displays this output.

	--force     - Ignore cached version information.
	CACHE PATH  - Path for non-tracked file to store git-describe version.
	OUT FILE    - Path to writable file that is included in the project's rc file.

	Version information is expected to be in the format: vMajor.Minor.Fix[-stage#]
	Where -stage# is alpha, beta, or rc. ( example: v1.0.0-alpha0 )

	Example pre-build event:
	CALL $(SolutionDir)GIT-VS-VERSION-GEN.bat "$(IntDir)\" "$(SolutionDir)..\src\gen-versioninfo.h"

Notes
-----
Generated definitions:
  - GEN_VER_VERSION_STRING
    Terminated string of the git tag minus the leading 'v'.

  - GEN_VER_DIGITAL_VERSION
    16 bit int values representing Major, Minor, Fix, Patches.

  - GEN_VER_VERSION_HEX
    Concatenated hex representation of padded Major, Minor, Fix, Patches.

  - GEN_VER_COMMENT_STRING
    Git tag message value with pre-release stage info appended.

  - GEN_VER_PRIVATE_FLAG
  - GEN_VER_PRIVATE_STRING
    When HEAD is dirty flag is set.  String is set to 'Custom Build'.

  - GEN_VER_PATCHED_FLAG
    Set when there are commits between the tag and the commit being built.

  - GEN_VER_PRERELEASE_FLAG
    Set when the tag includes 'alpha', 'beta' or 'rc'.

Executing the script with the --test argument will generate an example
repository with tagged commits from an alpha stage to next full version
release along with a few maintenance patches and examples of building from
non-tagged commits and then output the data in comma separated format.
